# automated-chatpdf-selenium
A python script that uses selenium to upload a PDF file to ChatPDF and then iterate through a list of questions.

## Usage
You will need python installed as well as the python package selenium. This script uses Firefox and Geckodriver as the browser so you will need those too.

There's two lines after the imports dealing with the location of the PDF file and the list of questions to ask, in an array format. Modify these for your purposes. The script has questions one may ask about a legal case as examples.
